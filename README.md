# End-to-End-Data-Science-Project
# BRFSS Health Predictions

## Overview
This repository explores predictive modeling and actionable insights for public health using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. 
The focus is on detecting and forecasting chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and depression through machine learning models.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive analysis of the BRFSS dataset, including correlations and distribution patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Application of Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression for predictive modeling.
- **Visualizations:** Insightful visual representations of health-related variables and their relationships.

## Key Files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `data/`: Contains the BRFSS dataset (CVD_cleaned.csv).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- `images/`: Visualizations generated during the analysis.


## Usage
- Run Jupyter notebooks to explore analyses and visualizations.
- Utilize machine learning models for predictive insights.


## Conclusion
This project improves understanding of public health issues and facilitates informed decision-making. 
For precise predictive models, constant modification and collaboration with experts in the field are essential.
